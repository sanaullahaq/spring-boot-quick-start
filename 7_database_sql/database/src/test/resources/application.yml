#This is a JDBC URL used to configure an H2 in-memory database with specific settings. Let's break it down:
#
#  jdbc:h2:mem:testDB
#
#  jdbc:h2 → Specifies the H2 database driver.
#  mem:testDB → Uses an in-memory database named testDB (data is lost when the application shuts down).
#  MODE=PostgreSQL
#
#  Configures H2 to behave like PostgreSQL, making it easier to migrate or test applications originally designed for PostgreSQL.
#  DATABASE_TO_LOWER=TRUE
#
#  Ensures all unquoted identifiers (e.g., table/column names) are automatically converted to lowercase, similar to PostgreSQL behavior.
#  DEFAULT_NULL_ORDERING=HIGH
#
#  Sets the default ordering of NULL values in ORDER BY clauses.
#  HIGH means NULL values will be treated as the highest values (i.e., they will appear last in ascending order and first in descending order).
#  This configuration is useful for testing applications that use PostgreSQL but need an in-memory database for quick setup and teardown.
